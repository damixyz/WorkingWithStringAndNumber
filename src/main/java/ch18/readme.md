### Checking whether two strings are anagrams

Write a program that checks whether two strings are anagrams. Consider that an anagram of a string is a permutation of
this string by ignoring capitalization and space.

#### Note:

Two strings that have the same character, but that are in different order, are anagrams.
Some definitions impose that anagrams are case-insensitive and/or that space (blanks) should be ignored.
